### Hi 
•͡˘㇁•͡˘

My name is Ben (he/him). I'm a graduate from the Lambda School (Now Bloom Intisute of Technology) Full-Stack Web Dev program, and am available for hire.

Currently I'm learning more about TypeScript, Python, and Solidity.

React, NextJS, PostgreSQL, and Express are tools I spend a lot of time with right now.
